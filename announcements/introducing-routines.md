# Hello World — Routines Coming Soon

We're excited to announce that we're shifting our focus to building **Routines** — a powerful new feature designed to help you automate and streamline your workflows.

## What are Routines?

Routines will enable you to create automated sequences of actions that run based on triggers and conditions you define. Think of them as your personal workflow assistant, handling repetitive tasks so you can focus on what matters.

## What to expect

- Flexible automation rules and triggers
- Seamless integration with your existing Drift setup
- Intuitive interface for building and managing routines
- Coming to your Drift instance soon

## Stay tuned

We'll be sharing updates on progress, early previews, and how you can get involved. Keep an eye on your inbox for announcements!
